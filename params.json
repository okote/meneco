Large-scale metabolic networks as well as measured data sets suffer from substantial incompleteness. This approach builds upon a formal method for analyzing large-scale metabolic networks mapping its principles into Answer Set Programming. The approach can then be used to check whether a drafted network provides the synthesis routes to comply with the required functionality. If this fails, the draft network can be completed by importing reactions from metabolic reference network stemming from other organisms until the obtained network provides the measured functionality. \r\n\r\n### Installation \r\n\r\nYou can install meneco by running:\r\n\r\n\t$ pip install --user meneco\r\n\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nTypical usage is:\r\n\r\n\t$ meneco draftnetwork repairnetwork seeds targets\r\n\r\nFor more options you can ask for help as follows:\r\n\r\n\t$ meneco --h\r\n        usage: meneco.py [-h] [--enumerate] draftnetwork repairnetwork seeds targets\r\n\r\n        positional arguments:\r\n          draftnetwork   metabolic network in SBML format\r\n          repairnetwork  metabolic network in SBML format\r\n          seeds          seeds in SBML format\r\n          targets        targets in SBML format\r\n\r\n        optional arguments:\r\n          -h, --help     show this help message and exit\r\n          --enumerate    enumerate all minimal completions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Samples\r\n\r\nSample files for the reconstruction of ectocarpus are available here:\r\n      [ectocyc.sbml](http://bioasp.github.io/downloads/samples/ectodata/ectocyc.sbml) [metacyc_16-5.sbml](http://bioasp.github.io/downloads/samples/ectodata/metacyc_16-5.sbml) [seeds.sbml](http://bioasp.github.io/downloads/samples/ectodata/seeds.sbml) [targets.sbml](http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~sthiele/bioasp/downloads/samples/ectodata/targets.sbml)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Related publications\r\n\r\nExtending the Metabolic Network of Ectocarpus Siliculosus using Answer Set Programming.
