Large-scale metabolic networks as well as measured data sets suffer from substantial incompleteness. This approach builds upon a formal method for analyzing large-scale metabolic networks mapping its principles into Answer Set Programming. The approach can then be used to check whether a drafted network provides the synthesis routes to comply with the required functionality. If this fails, the draft network can be completed by importing reactions from metabolic reference network stemming from other organisms until the obtained network provides the measured functionality. \r\n\r\n**Related publications:**\r\n\r\nExtending the Metabolic Network of Ectocarpus Siliculosus using Answer Set Programming.
